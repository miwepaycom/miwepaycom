One option is to eliminate high-cost credit at the state level. For example, since 2024, South Dakota, Nebraska, New Mexico, and Illinois have all capped rates for state-licensed credit at around a 36% annual percentage rate. These caps can protect consumers from payday and other high-cost loans as small loans—typically about $1,000, or less—become increasingly available from banks and credit unions.

The other choice is for a state to comprehensively reform its payday and small-dollar loan laws, such as lawmakers in Colorado, Hawaii, Ohio, and Virginia have done. This is proven to keep credit flowing to consumers—at much lower cost than payday loans have offered up to now, and with much better, more transparent outcomes.
