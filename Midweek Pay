How can states reform payday loans without limiting consumer access to credit?

States with high-cost loans should modernize their laws governing this credit. The key is to give consumers more time to repay their loans—with affordable payments and fair prices.

Here’s what’s happened in Colorado, Hawaii, Ohio, and Virginia after those states reformed their consumer credit codes: Consumers with damaged credit histories still have access to small loans but on much better terms than before. Payday loan stores continue to provide credit, as do state-licensed installment lenders—companies that provide small loans based on borrowers’ ability to repay and do not rely on access to customers' checking accounts as collateral—and financial technology firms, which have expanded their offerings. The interest rates on loans available in states that have passed reforms are still higher than on credit cards, but they are three to four times lower than before, saving typical borrowers hundreds of dollars each. Some payday loan stores have closed, and each remaining store serves more customers—which is where a lot of the consumer savings comes from.
